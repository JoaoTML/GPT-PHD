    "It is no surprise that AI has become a valuable tool for daily use, from simple uses such as being our assistant and answering a question such as \"What is the expected weather for today?\" to help us make important breakthroughs in essential fields such as Medicine. However,  where there are benefits that are also some consequences, the availability of models like the GPT started to increase the use of it for the simplest tasks. The dependency that some people have on AI is becoming clearer as the days go by, starting to lose their ability to solve problems on their own and lose cognitive capacities. This excessive use of AI is present in the education field and could bring serious consequences for the students' future, after all, their process of learning and developing their critical thought is completely cut off since they can simply use one of the immense range of models available to perform the task they want. All this excessive use made an important question arise: is it possible to use these tools without becoming too dependent?"

    "\n",
    "- the student had access to TobIAS to ask any question that could arise during the first exercises.\n",
    "- the following exercises were solved without TobIAS, to see if the model managed to teach the student the correct workflow so it could solve similar exercises alone.\n",
    "- after all exercises were solved, we asked the student for feedback.\n",

    "\n",
    "The testing of TobIAS with a student did not only serve to evaluate its performance and usefulness, but it also served as a way to request feedback and analyze what other features could be added. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the model's behavior and the student's feedback, we learned that TobIAS was intuitive to use for a beginner, which was great news since a tool that is easy to use allows a more smooth and efficient learning. However, there were times that TobIAS used certain terms that were too advanced for the student's level, making a necessity to train the model to adapt the language used according to how advanced a student's level is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature-wise, we received some useful suggestions as to what could be added to TobIAS's capabilities. It was requested that we implement speech-to-text and image processing capabilities to make it easier for a student to describe/provide the exercise that isn't clear. With a more detailed description of what the problem is, the guides that are given could get a significant improvement, making TobIAS an even more valuable tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a more advanced feature to consider adding is integration with a RAG. For now, TobIAS is able to guide through mathematical problems with ease since there is no exterior background that is needed, but with the integration of a RAG containing information such as a full background of Portugal's History or a library of Portugal's literature, our tool would take a major step by widening the fields that can help students with.\n",
